 `COURSE 3`
 `Functions in Swift`
 INTRO —A function is
 a fundamental building block of a computer program
 and allows us
 to write chunks of code
 that we can reuse
 as often as we need .
 In Swift , functions are quite powerful
 and in this course,
 we'll start by taking a look at the syntax
 and how functions work .
 Once we have the fundamentals underway ,
 we'll look at how we can customize our parameter names ,
 add default values
 and return multiple values from a function call .
 
 What you'll learn :
 • Functions
 • Parameters
 • Named Parameters
 • Default Values
 • Multiple Return Values

/**
 Until now ,
 all the code we have written in our previous courses was executed line by line ,
 from top to bottom in our playgrounds . What if we don't want to do that ?
 Sometimes we may want a certain block of code to be executed only when we need it .
 Now you might be thinking this is what control flow statements are for , right ?
 Well , control flow statements are good for executing code based on logical conditions ,
 but what we are looking for , is ,
 a self-contained block of code that performs a very specific task .
 This is exactly what a function is ,
 a sequence of instructions that perform a very specific task ,
 packaged up as a unit .
 You can think of the coffee maker as a function .
 It performs a very specific set of tasks in order to make coffee .
 
 `WIKIPEDIA` : In computer programming ,
 a `subroutine` is a sequence of program instructions
 that performs a specific task ,
 packaged as a unit .
 This unit can then be used in programs wherever that particular task should be performed .
 Subprograms may be defined within programs ,
 or separately in libraries that can be used by many programs .
 In different programming languages , a subroutine may be called
 a procedure ,
 a function ,
 a routine ,
 a method ,
 or a subprogram .
 The generic term callable unit is sometimes used .
