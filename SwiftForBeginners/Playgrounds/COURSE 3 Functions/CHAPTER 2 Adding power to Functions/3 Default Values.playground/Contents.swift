 `3 Default Values`
 INTRO â€”If we have a function parameter that often set to
 a particular value ,
 we can specify a default value to save us some typing .
 In this video
 we add a default value to a parameter
 and take a look at how this changes the function behaviour .

 `NOTE` : For the sake of simplicity again ,
 we are passing in the color as a String for now .
 `func carpetCost(havingArea area: Int , colorOfCarpet color: String) { ... }`
 `NOTE` : We assume that we are always going to be passing it in as a lowercase String .
 Now in real code ,
 because this is a String ,
 and it can be written as an uppercase string ,
 we would need to check for both .
 In fact there are better ways of doing this ,
 but we'll get there one day .
 
 What if we only wanted to interact with `carpetCost()` directly ?
 And by that I mean ,
 what if we don't want to first calculate the area
 and then pass that value to a second function ?
 No problem .
 We can easily get this done
 because we can call one function from inside another function :

 Rather than calling the `calculate area( )` function
 with hard coded values outside of this function , as we had earlier .
 `let secondLength = 15`
 `let secondWidth = 22`
 `let areaOfSecondRoom = secondLength * secondWidth`
 `carpetCost(havingArea : areaOfSecondRoom , colorOfCarpet : "Blue")`
 We are passing in the arguments for the parameters to the `carpetCostHaving( )` function
 through to the `areaWith()` function :
 `let areaOfRoom = areaWith(length : length , width : width)`
 Now ,
 in this hypothetical scenario ,
 it is very rare that our contractor is asked to install a carpet color other than tan .
 Turns out everybody just wants a tan carpet .
 So having to input the value tan nine times out of ten ,
 is kinda cumbersome .
 We can solve that problem though ,
 because function parameters can take default values .
 We are going to actually assign a default value to the `color` constant :

/**
 _So how does this change things ?_
 So , when we start typing out the function , `carpetCostHaving2` ,
 Xcode's autocomplete presents us with a few results .
 Now before we just had one result .
 Now we have two results ,
 and you'll notice an interesting thing .
 The first result is the one that we expected just like before
 where we have an argument specification for `length` , `width` , and the `color` .
 But in the second one , `colorOfCarpet` is omitted . If we select this one ,
 we are basically telling Swift that we want to accept that default value for carpetColor .
 Now if we use the first one ,
 we are saying that we want to specify the carpet color directly and not use the default .
