/**
 `COURSE 1`
 `Swift Basics`
 INTRO —Welcome to the world of Swift development !
 In this course ,
 we are going to learn how to program from absolute scratch
 using Swift
 and learn many fundamental concepts
 that will get you started writing code immediately .
 No prior programming experience is needed
 and we are going to have a lot of fun !

/**
 `CHAPTER 1`
 `An Introduction to Swift Programming .`
 INTRO CHAPTER 1 —We'll begin our foray into programming by understanding
 a very simple concept
 - how to store and retrieve information ( also called data )
 using constructs
 called variables and constants .
 Before we can do that however ,
 we need to review our tool set ,
 and in this set of videos,
 we'll take a look at what Xcode is,
 and the environment we're going to learn in - Playgrounds .
 After that , we’ll dive right in , and look at
 how to create and use variables and constants ,
 how to properly name them
 and what data means in programming .

/**
 `1 What is Swift ?`
 INTRO —Before we jump into writing code and learning about programming ,
 let's spend a quick second talking about what Swift is .
 There are many programming languages out there
 and it's worth understanding
 why we're learning Swift and what it is used for .

/**
 `1.1 Types`
 In a spoken language,
 the building blocks are letters and resulting vocabulary .
 In a Programming language ,
 the building blocks are called `Types` .
 Types are a construct to represent different kinds of data ,
 like letters or numbers .
 
 `1.2 Syntax`
 In a spoken language ,
 the rules ,
 from which we construct words and sentences ,
 are called grammar .
 Similarly , in a programming language ,
 we also have a set of rules , and we call it `Syntax` .
 Syntax are commands ,
 special words ,
 and punctuation
 you use to put together a program .
