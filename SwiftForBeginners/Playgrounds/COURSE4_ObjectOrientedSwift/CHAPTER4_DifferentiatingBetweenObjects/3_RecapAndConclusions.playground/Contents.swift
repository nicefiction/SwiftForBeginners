/**
 `3 Recap and Conclusions`
 INTRO —We are done !
 Let's recap the entire course and call it a day .
 */
/**
 Before we wrap up
 and talk about everything we have covered so far
 it is important to address one point .
 We learned of two ways we can `encapsulate data` ,
 (`1`) `structs` and (`2`) `classes` .
 _When should we use either one ?_
 A simple rule for now is
 to use `structs`
 to represent `simple values` as mentioned.
 A coordinate point is just a set of values .
 It doesn't really have an identity .
 `Classes` , on the other hand ,
 are really good at representing more than just values . 
  
 Right now ,
 it is hard to make that distinction
 since we just learned about `structs` and `classes` to begin with ,
 but honestly , really , don't worry about it .
 We are going to revisit this topic again several times
 until we have a good understanding of the differences between the two .
