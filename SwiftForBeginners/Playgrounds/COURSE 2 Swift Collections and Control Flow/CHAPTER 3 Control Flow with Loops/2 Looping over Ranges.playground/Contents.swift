 `2 Looping over ranges`
 INTRO â€”A `range` represents
 a series of numbers with a start and an end .
 Ranges are often used in conjunction with `for in loops`
 to write quick and convenient code .
 */
/**
 Sometimes , we want to express a range of values
 so that we can do things a certain number of times .
 In Swift
 we can express a `range` with two kinds of operators :
 
 (`1`) The first operator is called
 the `closed range operator` :

 A `closed range operator`,
 creates a range of values
 that includes the values 1 and 5 .
 
 (`2`) The second operator is called
 a `half open range operator` :

/**
 If we use the `half open range operator` ,
 we would get the numbers `1` , `2` , `3` , and `4` in our range .
 Both these operators can be used in conjunction with a `for in loop`
 to execute whatever code we want a certain number of times :
