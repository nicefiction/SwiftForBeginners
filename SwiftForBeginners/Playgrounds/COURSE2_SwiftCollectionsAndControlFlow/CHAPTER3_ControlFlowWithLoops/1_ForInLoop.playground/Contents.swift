/**
 `CHAPTER 3`
 `Control Flow With Loops`
 INTRO CHAPTER 3 —In computer programming , the order in which lines of code are evaluated can be altered by what are known as control flow statements. There are two kinds of statements - conditional statements that determined whether code should be executed or not, and loops, which indicate how many times we should execute a block of code. In this set of videos, we'll start by looking at the various types of loops at our disposal.

/**
 `1 For In Loop`
 INTRO —Going through an array and performing some task on each item in the array is a very common task and Swift has a built in control flow mechanism called a for in loop. In this video, let's take a look at the syntax of a for in loop, break it apart so we can understand what's going on and then get in some practice using it.
