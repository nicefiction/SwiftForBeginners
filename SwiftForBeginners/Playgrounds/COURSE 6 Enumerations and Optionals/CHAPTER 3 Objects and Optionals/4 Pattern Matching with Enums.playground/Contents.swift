/**
 `4 Pattern Matching With Enums`
 INTRO â€”Pattern matching in Swift lets you compare different values
 to execute code based on certain conditions .
 We took a look at basic pattern matching in previous courses
 but with enums we can take this a step further .
 */
/**
 To round things up,
 let's look at one final topic that involves both enums and optionals ,
 and that is pattern matching .
 We have learned about pattern matching before ,
 although we didn't call it that specifically ,
 when we use switch statements .
 We can switch on a value ,
 and then provide cases to match the value against ,
 we are providing a pattern to match it against .
 Enums allow us to take this to a whole new level
 because enums are made of different cases themselves .

 `ASIDE` :

 continue

 The continue statement tells a loop to stop what it is doing ,

 So , all we are doing , is ,
 jumping to the next value in the for loop .

 The power of cases have been extended to if statements as well .
 With enums,
 for loops and if statements become even more powerful

/**
 Most of this is syntactical sugar . Again ,
 they're just nice wrappers around stuff that you already know .
 You could have easily used the equality operator
 to compare the value to nickel or dime for each case ,
 and then executed some code .

/**
 The interesting thing here is ,
 remember how we said optionals are just enums under the hood with a none and a some case ?
 */
//enum Optional {
//    case some(String)
//    case none
//}
/**
 Now because they are just enums , we can use this same type of syntax ,
 if case and for case ,
 with an optional
 to unwrap the value .
 So , for example :
 */
let someOptional: Int? = 42


if case .some(let someLocalConstant) = someOptional {
    print(someLocalConstant)
}
/**
 This is actually not such great syntax ,
 but this is essentially what if let is doing  when you write it .
 if let is just comparing
 if the associated value in the some case
 is not an optional , and then it binds that ,
 so you can use it .
 Since if let is a lot nicer to read , we are just going to use that .
 I just want to connect the dots for you , and show you what is going on .
