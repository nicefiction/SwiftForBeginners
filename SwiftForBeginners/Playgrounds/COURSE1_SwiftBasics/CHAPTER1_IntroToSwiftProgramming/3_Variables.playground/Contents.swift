 `3 Variables`
 INTRO —Programming has a lot to do with information .
 You store information ,
 retrieve information ,
 and then you manipulate it .
 Learn how to store and retrieve information using variables .
 */
/**
 A variable is a construct to hold on to data .
 When we use data in a computer ,
 when we assign something to a variable ,
 it is actually being stored in the computer's memory .
 The variable , which serves as an easy way to refer to that information for us ,
 is also reference to the place in a computer's memory where this data is stored .
 Putting information or data in a variable like this , is called ,
 `assigning data to a variable` .
 Assigning is the act of associating some data on the right hand side
 with a name of a variable on the left hand side ,
 and we use the `assignment operator` to do this .
 When we create a new variable ,
 we are `declaring a variable` .
 Declaring a variable means,
 creating an entirely new one ,
 giving it a name
 and assigning some data to it .
 */
// Keyword var + Name + Assignment operator (=) + Data
/**
 `NOTE`:
 • The keyword `var` is only used to create a brand new variable.
 • Unlike boxes in the real world ,
 once you assign a value or data to a variable ,
 it forever can only hold that type of data .
 
 Swift uses a set of reserved keywords to define structure in our programs .
 The first reserved keyword we learned about is `var` .
 `var` is used to declare a variable .
 A variable is a container for data .
 And the reason we call it a variable , is ,
 because the container can hold different values .
 A value is a simple data point
 like text or a number .
 Every variable we create must be given a name .
 We then use this name to refer to data inside the container .
