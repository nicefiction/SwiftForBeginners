/**
 `4 Constants`
 INTRO â€”Constants are similar to variables
 as they too are used to store information .
 However ,
 as their name states
 they remain constant
 which means their value cannot be changed .
 */
/**
 `ANGELA`:
 Variables keep track of the state of your app .
 e.g.:
 Which level is the user on ? ,
 How many monsters have they killed ?
 Constants hold pieces of data that never change .
 They also take up less memory space than variables .
 e.g.: Your API keys . Your URL .

/**
 `ASIDE`:
 A red circle with a white dot
 indicates
 that you have an error , and that Xcode has a recommendation on how to fix it .
 If you click on the symbol , it offers a fix .
 Compare this to the other error symbol . It only displays an error message .
